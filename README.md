## Backup all posts from a given Fotolog: pictures and its respective descriptions and comments.

:scream: :spaghetti:

WTF list:

- main1.js: *should* log an array containing links of all posts of a given Fotolog.
- main2.js: Gets links of the 30 last posts, fetches one arbitrarily chosen post and downloads its picture to `content/picture.jpg`
- main3.js: Does nothing. Its just me trying Design Patterns for the 1st time, writing down ideas, but not getting anywhere.
